# 100-days-of-ML-MovieLens-data-


This is the first project that I did when I started with the 100 days of Machine Learning. If the Jupyter Notebook doesn't load the first time, just reload it and it should work because it doesn't always seem to work on the first try.

I wrote a blog explaining my reasoing behind the central question of this specific dataset, what I found and what I think it means. 

Please check out the following blog and if you have comments/constructive criticism, please leave it in the comments below.

While you are at it, give my blog a follow if you would like to see me try to make a fool out of myself!!!
