# 100-days-of-ML-MovieLens-data-


This is the first project that I did when I started with the 100 days of Machine Learning. 

I wrote a blog explaining my reasoing behind the central question of this specific dataset, what I found and what I think it means. 

Please check out the following blog and if you have comments/constructive criticism, please leave it in the comments below.
